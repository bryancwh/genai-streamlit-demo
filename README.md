# Working Backwards Accelerator (GenAI) Workshop
This application builds a basic web interface to collect a prompt, calls an AI model for a response, and sends the results to an emailing system - demonstrating a full workflow using Streamlit, Bedrock and AWS services.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/bryancwh/genai-streamlit-demo.git`

2. Install requirements:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the app:

`python3 -m streamlit run app.py`

The app should now be running locally at http://localhost:8501
Make any changes to the code in app.py and the changes will be live-reloaded in your browser.
